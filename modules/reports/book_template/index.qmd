- Basic statistics (cell counts, feature counts, UMI distributions)
- Quality control metrics (mitochondrial gene percentages, ribosomal gene percentages)
- Visualization of key quality metrics
- Cell distribution analyses
- Top expressed genes
- Filtering recommendations
- Quality control summaries

## Samples Analyzed

The following sections contain detailed reports for each sample processed through the pipeline.
